### Jupyter Notebook Installation Instructions

Jupyter can be installed using Anaconda or pip. Anaconda is recommended for new users. 
You can follow the steps from [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
Installation steps using Anaconda are also given below. Note that we prefer Python 3.5/3.6. All sample iPython notebooks will use Python 3.5.

**For Windows:**

Download the Anaconda installer from [here](http://continuum.io/downloads.html).
Double-click the Anaconda installer and follow the prompts to install to the default location.

NOTE: Install Anaconda to a directory path that does not contain spaces or unicode characters. Do not install as Administrator unless admin privileges are required. If you encounter any issues during installation, temporarily disable your anti-virus software during install, then immediately re-enable it. If you have installed for all users, uninstall Anaconda and re-install it for your user only and try again.

**For MacOS:**

* Download the command-line installer from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
* In your terminal window type one of the below and follow the instructions:

Python 3.6 version
```
bash Anaconda3-4.3.1-MacOSX-x86_64.sh 
```

Python 2.7 version
```
bash Anaconda2-4.3.1-MacOSX-x86_64.sh 
```

**For Linux:**

* Download the command-line installer from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
